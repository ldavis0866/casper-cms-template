I’M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT I’VE LEARNED IN MY JOURNEY MOST FROM EXPERIENCE, SOME OF THEM I’VE HEARD IN PASSING, MANY OF THEM I’M STILL PRACTICING, BUT ALL OF THEM I DO BELIEVE ARE TRUE.

LIFE IS NOT EASY! IT IS NOT! DON’T TRY TO MAKE IT THAT WAY. LIFE IS NOT FAIR, IT NEVER WAS, IT ISN’T NOW AND IT WON’T EVER BE. DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP, THE ENTITLEMENT TRAP OF FEELING LIKE YOU ARE A VICTIM. YOU ARE NOT. GET OVER IT AND GET ON WITH IT.
